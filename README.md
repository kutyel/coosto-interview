> My first Vue.js app, coded during a technical interview! ðŸ˜Ž

## Assignment

Create a todo application in Vue. The API is available at http://weslezw230.230.axc.nl/notes. We would recommend you to use the `vueÂ­-cli`, which can be retrieved from [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vueÂ­cli).

This application is going to be deployed in a corporate environment. The interviewers are the
stakeholders/ product owners.

### API endpoints

CMD | Endpoint | Comments
--- | --- | ---
GET | http://weslezw230.230.axc.nl/notes
GET | http://weslezw230.230.axc.nl/notes/@id | (returns full post)
POST | http://weslezw230.230.axc.nl/notes | (only returns a message)
PUT | http://weslezw230.230.axc.nl/notes | (only returns a message)
DELETE | http://weslezw230.230.axc.nl/notes | (only returns a message)

Weâ€™re going to assess you on the reasoning behind the decisions. The goal is not to have a fully functional working application (but would be awesome), weâ€™re much more interested in the way you set up the project and what your thoughts are when building an application from scratch.

If you think something is a good idea, but you donâ€™t see any room to fit this in this timebox, please make a remark in your code that that still should be done.

## Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
